# Deep Agent Framework Architecture for Market Research

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for enhancing the current bitebase-ai agent into a production-ready deep agent framework specifically designed for comprehensive market research. The framework combines patterns from langchain-ai/deep-agents-from-scratch with specialized market research capabilities and open-source MCP tool integrations.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Enhanced State Management System

```typescript
interface MarketResearchAgentState extends DeepAgentState {
  // Core deep agent state (todos, files, messages)
  
  // Market research specific state
  research_context: {
    target_company?: string
    industry_sector?: string
    geographic_scope?: string[]
    research_objectives?: string[]
    time_horizon?: string
  }
  
  // Knowledge layers
  market_intelligence: {
    competitors: Record<string, CompetitorProfile>
    market_trends: TrendAnalysis[]
    consumer_insights: ConsumerProfile[]
    financial_data: FinancialAnalysis[]
    regulatory_landscape: RegulatoryUpdate[]
  }
  
  // Research workflow state
  research_plan: ResearchPlan
  evidence_collection: EvidenceItem[]
  validation_status: ValidationState
  report_sections: ReportSection[]
}
```

   - Language processing and translation services

### 4. Market Research Workflow Engine

#### Core Workflows:

1. **Research Planning Workflow**
   ```
   Input: Research objectives, target company/industry
   → Task decomposition by sub-agents
   → Resource allocation and timeline planning  
   → Evidence collection strategy
   → Validation criteria definition
   ```

2. **Data Collection Workflow**
   ```
   Research Plan → Sub-agent task delegation
   → Parallel data collection via MCP tools
   → Real-time progress tracking
   → Cross-source validation
   → Evidence synthesis
   ```

3. **Analysis & Synthesis Workflow**
   ```
   Raw Data → Sub-agent specialized analysis
   → Cross-agent collaboration and validation
   → Pattern identification and insights
   → Report generation and visualization
   → Executive summary creation
   ```

### 5. Sequential Thinking Integration

The framework integrates the sequential thinking MCP to enable deep analytical reasoning:

1. **Research Question Decomposition**: Breaking complex market research questions into manageable sub-questions
2. **Evidence Evaluation**: Systematic assessment of data quality and relevance
3. **Hypothesis Formation & Testing**: Iterative hypothesis refinement based on evidence
4. **Synthesis Planning**: Strategic thinking about how to combine findings into insights

### 6. Business Intelligence Matrix Tools

Specialized tools for standard business analysis frameworks:

1. **SWOT Analysis Generator**
2. **Porter's Five Forces Analysis**
3. **BCG Growth-Share Matrix**
4. **Ansoff Matrix (Market-Product Analysis)**
5. **Value Chain Analysis**
6. **PEST/PESTLE Analysis**
7. **Business Model Canvas**
8. **Competitive Positioning Maps**
